## Introduction

Patient Manager is a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) application for **_general practitioners_** (GP)
who work in clinics to manage their patient list. This includes a recording/retrieval of
past record of visit, scheduling of the next appointment, and some other features listed below.
With the Patient Manager, GPs will be able to reduce paperwork and have a more efficient way
to organize the records of their patients.

   the project into IDEA.
   > ‚ùó Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
1. Verify the setup: Run `seedu.duke.PatientManager` and try a few commands.\
   [Run the tests](#appendix-e-instructions-for-manual-testing) to ensure they all pass.

## Design & Implementation

### Architecture
<img src="./images/architecture_diagram.png" width="600">

The Architecture Diagram shown above gives a high-level explanation of Patient Manager.
Given below is a brief overview of each component.

`Main` contains the class `PatientManager`.

This class is responsible for:
- When the app is launched: Initializing the other components in the correct sequence and connecting them with each other
- When the app exits: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary

`Commons` contains constants that are shared across the other classes.

`UI` is responsible for displaying the all messages generated by Patient Manager to the screen.

`Logic` parses and executes commands.

`Model` contains the data of Patient Manager in memory.

`Storage` reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

#### How the architecture components interact with each other

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add S1234567D`.

<img src="./images/sequence_diagram_overview.png" width="750">

The sections below give more details for each component.

### UI Component

The `UI` component implements methods for:

- displaying messages and exceptions in a standardized manner

### Logic Component

<img src="./images/class_diagram_logic.png" width="750">

API: `Parser.java` and `Command.java`

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to tokenize and parse the user command
1. This creates a `Command` object which is then executed by the `PatientManager` class via the `execute()` method
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient)
1. Within the `execute()` method, the `Command` object can instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions,
   such as displaying the command output to the screen

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component after Patient Manager recieves `add S1234567D`
as an input, and the `execute()` API call is made.\
{TODO: Add sequence diagram here}

### Model Component

<img src="./images/class_diagram_model.png" width="200">

API: `Data.java`

`Data`

- stores a `SortedMap<String, Patient>`, which maps the patient's NRIC/FIN number to their corresponding `Patient` instance
- implements methods to add new patients and delete existing patients
- implements methods to load an existing patient's medical records

A `Patient` contains:

- the patient's NRIC/FIN number, which uniquely identifies the patient
- a `TreeMap<LocalDate, Record>` which maps the patient's consultation dates to the visit records for that date

A `Record` contains:

- all the symptoms recorded by a GP during the consultation
- all the diagnoses made by a GP during the consultation
- all the prescriptions made by a GP during the consultation
- the most recently added symptom/diagnosis/prescription, which corresponds to the most recently executed `record` command


### Storage Component

API: `Storage.java`

The storage component is in charge of printing all patients' data into a file, and loading from it when the application restarts. 
This would ensure that patient data is not lost after exiting the application.

To initialise this component, the `SortedMap<String, Patient>` from the Data class is passed during object creation.
This SortedMap<String, Patient> is the entire list of patients and their records.

Then, we can call the `save(SortedMap<String, Patient> patientData)` method to save the SortedMap into a file whenever changes are made.
The file is specified by the variable FILE_PATH in Constants class.

The reverse process would be the `load()` method. The file from the specified FILE_PATH is loaded into a String, which is 
converted to a SortedMap<String, Patient> afterwards.

`Storage.java`:

- facilitates the saving of application data into a text file
- facilitates the loading of application data from the aforementioned text file
- convert records to string
- converts string to records

### Exception Component

API: `BaseException.java` and its subclasses

`BaseException.java`:
- handles all exceptions that occur during the execution of PatientManager
- can report an error message, prompting the user to provide a syntatically correct command
- may also report the cause of error for debugging purposes

### Commons

Constants used by multiple classes are stored in the `seedu.duke.Commons` class.

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain details are implemented.

### Tokenizing User Input

The parser is one of the core components in charge of parsing all user input commands into program-understandable commands and
arguments. For the ease of expansion of this program's functionality as well as for its testability, reflection is used to invoke
commands.

First is the initialization of this parser. A `Ui` instance and a `Data` instance is passed and stored. This is important as
these two will be passed to logic components (command classes) later.

Then, we can parse a user-input string by passing it to `parse()`. We use an example of this:
```
record 01/05/2021 /s coughing, fever /p panadol Paracetamol 500mg*20
```

This is broken into a few steps:

1. Initialize an empty hashmap, called `arguments`.
1. Tokenize using **any number of consecutive white spaces**.
1. Taken out the first token as command, i.e. `record`. Push it into the hash map using **key** `command`.
   Create a new empty **list** with default **key** `payload`.
1. Check if next token starts with `/`. No, so we add it to the list: `list = ['payload']`.
1. Check if next token starts with `/`. Yes, so we concatenate all tokens in the list to one string use delimiter ` `
   (empty whitespace). Put it into the hash map using the key `payload`.
   **Reset the list**, and set new key to `s` (the part after this `/`).
1. Repeat same process, we have `list = ['coughing,']`
1. Repeat same process, we have `list = ['coughing,', 'fever']`
1. Same process, `coughing, fever` is pushed into arguments hash map with key `s`. Reset the list, and new key set to `p`.
1. ... 

At the end, we have an argument hashmap like this:

| Key     | Value                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| command | record                        |
| payload | 01/05/2021                    |
| s       | coughing, fever               |
| p       | panadol Paracetamol 500mg\*20 |

Next step is the initialization of a command class. Since we have command `record`, the program finds a class called
`RecordCommand` under the module `seedu.duke.command` (first character being capitalized, then concatenated with 'Command').
Since this is a valid command, this class exists. If the class does not exist, it means the command is not yet
implemented by this program.

After finding the command class, it is initialized with `(ui, data, arguments)`. `ui` and `data` are the two references
passed in when initializing the parser, and the `arguments` is the hash map we just obtained by parsing the input. The result
of the initialization (i.e. the instance of the command class) is returned.

Since all command classes implements the abstract method `execute()`, the main loop just need to execute this method to call out
the actual logic of this command.

> ‚ùó Note: Since we are tokenizing the user input with **any number of white spaces** and concatenate all tokens belong to the
> same key back using **single whitespace**, the number of white spaces input has no effect on the actual arguments being parsed.
> For example, the following two input has exactly the same result after being parsed.
> ```
> record 01/05/2021 /s coughing, fever
> record 01/05/2021 /s coughing,                 fever
> ```

### Exception Handling

All unexpected behaviour encountered by Patient Manager is signalled and handled with exceptions. Since the generic
`Exception` is too broad, we have created a few custom exception classes to relay exception information.

`BaseException.java`:

- inherits from the generic `Exception`
- base class of all custom exceptions
- overwrites the `toString()` method to make it output messages more meaningfully

`InvalidInputException.java`

- inherits from `BaseException`
- is used to handle all unexpected user input, like invalid commands, wrong NRIC numbers, etc.
- implies that user should re-enter correct command and arguments
- has a member enumerate (`enum`) `Type` to give a fixed set of exception messages, which can be passed as the argument
  for exception initialization (see example below)

`StorageException.java`

- inherits from `BaseException`
- is used to handle expected events occur during loading and saving data from/onto the hard disk
- shows that usual saving/loading action cannot be done, and there might be the case of a data loss after closing the program

`UnknownException.java`

- inherits from `BaseException`
- is used to handle unusual events that should not be trigger by user
- signals an internal error of the program and should be fixed during next iteration or through hotfixes

During invocation of an exception, there are two ways to invoke:
```java
throw new InvalidInputException(InvalidInputException.Type.EMPTY_STRING);
// e is a Throwable, e.g. a captured exception in a try-catch block
// for this UNKNOWN_COMMAND, the e should be of type ClassNotFoundException
throw new InvalidInputException(InvalidInputException.Type.UNKNOWN_COMMAND, e);
```

If a second argument is passed, it is called the **cause** of the exception. For example, the user's wrong input
triggers **ClassNotFoundException**, and then this exception is captured in `Parser` which then **causes**
`InvalidInputException`. If a **cause** is passed in, it will be printed out for the user as well. See the difference:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Input command and/or arguments are invalid:
        Empty string is found when trying to parse command!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
wrongcommand
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Input command and/or arguments are invalid:
        Invalid command is provided!
... and is caused by ...
        java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: seedu.duke.command.WrongcommandCommand
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Appendix A: Product scope

### Target user profile

The target users for this application are _general practitioners_ (GP) who work in clinics.
They are keen to reduce the paperwork that is required of them during consultation sessions, so that they may focus more on the consultation itself.
Also, they would like to have a more efficient way to organize the records of their patients.

### Value proposition

Through Patient Manager, general practitioners are able to manage patients faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
The typical paperwork, such as recording of symptoms, diagnoses and prescriptions, are greatly reduced through digital input.
